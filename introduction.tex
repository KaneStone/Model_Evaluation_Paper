\section{Introduction} 

Coupled chemistry climate models are designed to address the interactions between atmospheric chemistry and the Earth-system. This involves the interactions between ozone, and green house gases (GHGs), and the Earth's dynamical climate and weather system. The importance in increasing the understanding these links is very important for the Australian region due to the annual Spring time Antarctic ozone depletion. The Australian region will be effected heavily by these interactions over the course of the next century by the recovery of ozone as well as the changes in GHGs. Thus, simulations of these effects are very important in understanding the future of Australia's weather and climate.

\begin{itemize}
\item Chemistry Climate Modelling and CCMI.
\item Australian chemistry climate modelling in the past
\item Why it is important (link the dynamical and chemical aspects of the climate system, future changes in ozone, etc.)
\item Importance for the Australian region (Shifting of the jet stream. SAM trends â€“ not sure how relevant due to prescribed SSTs?)
