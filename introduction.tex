\section{Introduction} 


\begin{itemize}
\item Chemistry Climate Modelling and CCMI.
\item Australian chemistry climate modelling in the past
\item Why it is important (link the dynamical and chemical aspects of the climate system, future changes in ozone, etc.)
\item Importance for the Australian region (Shifting of the jet stream. SAM trends â€“ not sure how relevant due to prescribed SSTs?)
