ACCESS-CCM REF-C1 and REF-C2 October averaged total column ozone between 60˚S-90˚S compared to observations from the Bodeker Scientific Total Ozone Column Database and the CCMVal-2 ensemble median (top panel), October averaged temperature at 50 hPa between 60˚S-90˚S compared to ERA-Interim data and the CCMVal-2 ensemble median (middle panel), and October averaged zonal wind at 50 hPa between 50˚S-70˚S compared to ERA-Interim and the CCMVal-2 ensemble median (bottom panel). Shaded regions show the 95\perc confidence of the median derived using a bootstrapping method.
