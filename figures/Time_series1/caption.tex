\label{fig:time_series}
Time series of REF-C1 and REF-C2 total ozone column and 50\,hPa temperature averaged between 60-90$^{\circ}$, and 50\,hPa zonal wind averaged between 50-70$^{\circ}$ compared with ERA-Interim, total column ozone database observations, and the CCMVal-2 ensemble. Solid lines have undergone a 10 year smoothing.
