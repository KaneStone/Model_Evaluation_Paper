\section{Model Evaluation}

Figure 1 shows time series of Antarctic total ozone column, temperature at 50 hPa and zonal winds at 50 hPa for our Reference-C1 and the historical part of our Reference-C2 simulation compared to observations, ERA-Interim data, and the CCMVal-2 ensemble. Our Reference-C1 and Reference-C2 simulations are simulating larger values of total ozone column consistently over the entire historical time series compared to observations from the Bodeker Scientific total column ozone database and the CCMVal-2 ensemble. However, the total amount of ozone depletion from 1960 to 2010 is similar compared to observations and the CCMVal-2 ensemble. There is also slight differences between the Reference-C1 and Reference-C2 runs in the historical period, with the only significant difference between the two runs before 2005 being the differences in SSTs and SICs.
